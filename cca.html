      <p> Scouts do outdoor cooking, which we cook outside. We start a campfire and cook marshmallows, penne etc. We also do pioneering, which is to build structures by tying wood using ropes. This allows us to built almost any structures.
          Lastly, we also dofoot drills. We learnt different commands and learn how to march
