  <h2> Brief introduction about me. </h2>
  <p> My name is Xavier Seah and I was born on 7 January 2005. I am currently attending  <a href="http://dunmanhigh.moe.edu.sg/">Dunman High School </a>,
    </p>
  <p> I was discovered and adopted by a Kansas farm couple, raised as Clark Kent, and imbued with a strong moral compass.</p>
  <p> Very early on I started to display various superhuman abilities, which, upon reaching maturity, I resolved to use for the benefit of humanity through a secret "Superman" identity.</p>
  
  <h2> Where  you'll find me. </h2>
  <p> I reside and operate in the American city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(comics)"> Metropolis </a>
  as a journalist for the Daily Planet.</p>
